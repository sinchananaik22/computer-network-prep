# ðŸ“˜ Computer Network Interview Questions & Answers (For Freshers)

---

### **Question 1 â€“ What is computer network?**

**Answer:**
A computer network is a system where two or more computers and devices are connected to share data, resources, and communication.

* Communication can be **wired (Ethernet cables)** or **wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)**.
* Networks enable file sharing, internet access, and remote communication.

**Types of Computer Networks:**

* **LAN (Local Area Network):** Small area (home, office).
* **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Large geographical area (Internet).
* **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Connects LANs within a city.
* **PAN (Personal Area Network):** Small personal range (Bluetooth).

---

### **Question 2 â€“ What is an IP Address?**

**Answer:**
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a **unique identifier** assigned to each device in a network.

* Functions: Identifies the device and its location.
* **IPv4:** 32-bit, e.g., `192.168.1.1`.
* **IPv6:** 128-bit, developed to overcome IPv4 limitations.

---

### **Question 3 â€“ What are the different classes of IPv4?**

**Answer:**
IPv4 is divided into 5 classes:

* **Class A:** Large networks (over 16 million hosts).
* **Class B:** Medium networks (65,536 hosts).
* **Class C:** Small networks (256 hosts).
* **Class D:** Reserved for multicast.
* **Class E:** Experimental use.

---

### **Question 4 â€“ Explain different types of networks.**

**Answer:**

* **PAN:** Short-range (Bluetooth).
* **LAN:** Small area (home/office).
* **MAN:** Spans city/campus.
* **WAN:** Long-distance (Internet).
* **GAN:** Global (satellite-based).

---

### **Question 5 â€“ What is a VPN?**

**Answer:**
A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** creates a **secure encrypted tunnel** between your device and another network.

* Masks IP address, secures data.
* Used for remote work, bypassing geo-restrictions.

---

### **Question 6 â€“ What is the OSI Model?**

**Answer:**
The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** has 7 layers:

1. Physical â€“ Hardware, signals.
2. Data Link â€“ Error detection, MAC addressing.
3. Network â€“ Routing, IP addressing.
4. Transport â€“ Reliable delivery (TCP/UDP).
5. Session â€“ Session management.
6. Presentation â€“ Data formatting/encryption.
7. Application â€“ End-user services (HTTP, FTP).

---

### **Question 7 â€“ What is TCP/IP?**

**Answer:**
TCP/IP is a **protocol suite** used for Internet communication with 4 layers:

* Link Layer
* Internet Layer
* Transport Layer
* Application Layer

---

### **Question 8 â€“ What is DNS?**

**Answer:**
**DNS (Domain Name System)** translates domain names (e.g., `www.google.com`) into IP addresses.

---

### **Question 9 â€“ What is DHCP?**

**Answer:**
**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** automatically assigns IP addresses and network settings to devices.

---

### **Question 10 â€“ What is NAT?**

**Answer:**
**NAT (Network Address Translation)** converts private IPs to a public IP for internet access.

* Conserves IP addresses.
* Provides security.

---

### **Question 11 â€“ What is subnetting?**

**Answer:**
Subnetting divides a larger network into **smaller sub-networks** for better security and efficiency.

---

### **Question 12 â€“ What are firewalls?**

**Answer:**
A firewall monitors **incoming and outgoing traffic** and blocks unauthorized access based on rules.

---

### **Question 13 â€“ What is ICMP?**

**Answer:**
**ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** is used for error reporting and diagnostics (e.g., `ping`).

---

### **Question 14 â€“ What is ARP?**

**Answer:**
**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** maps **IP addresses to MAC addresses** within a LAN.

---

### **Question 15 â€“ Differentiate between TCP and UDP.**

**Answer:**

* **TCP:** Connection-oriented, reliable, slower (used in emails, web browsing).
* **UDP:** Connectionless, unreliable, faster (used in video streaming, gaming).

---

### **Question 16 â€“ What are unicasting, multicasting, broadcasting, anycasting?**

**Answer:**

* **Unicasting:** One-to-one.
* **Multicasting:** One-to-many (specific).
* **Broadcasting:** One-to-all.
* **Anycasting:** One-to-one (nearest node).

---

### **Question 17 â€“ What is a switch?**

**Answer:**
A **switch** connects devices in a LAN and forwards data based on **MAC addresses**.

---

### **Question 18 â€“ What is routing?**

**Answer:**
**Routing** is the process of selecting the best path for data packets using **routers and routing tables**.

---

### **Question 19 â€“ What are VLANs?**

**Answer:**
**VLAN (Virtual LAN):** Logically separates networks within the same physical switch for security and efficiency.

---

### **Question 20 â€“ Define bandwidth and latency.**

**Answer:**

* **Bandwidth:** Max data transfer rate (bps).
* **Latency:** Time delay in data transfer (ms).
